myshell - Simple POSIX Shell Implementation

Project Requirements Compliance
-------------------------------
✅ **Core Requirements Met:**
- [x] Written in C using POSIX system calls
- [x] Interactive shell with fork() and exec() for program execution
- [x] Accepts program name + arguments from standard input
- [x] Prompts for new command after program termination

- [x] Background job control with `&`

Features:
- Interactive prompt showing current working directory
- Execute external programs using fork+execvp
- Builtins: cd, exit
- Basic I/O redirection: >, >>, < (for single commands)
- Single pipe support: cmd1 | cmd2 (no redirection mixing)
 - Background jobs with `&`, `jobs` builtin, and `fg` builtin

Build and Compilation
--------------------
**Requirements:** Any Unix-like system with a C compiler (tested on macOS, Linux)

**Quick start:**
```bash
make          # Compile the shell
./myshell     # Run the interactive shell
make test     # Run automated tests
make clean    # Remove build artifacts
```

**Manual compilation (if make unavailable):**
```bash
cc -std=c17 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -g -o myshell myshell.c
```

Usage Examples
--------------
**Basic commands:**
```bash
ls -l /tmp                    # External program execution
echo "Hello World"            # Arguments with spaces
cd /home/user                 # Built-in directory change
pwd                          # Show current directory
```

**I/O Redirection:**
```bash
cat file.txt > output.txt     # Redirect stdout
echo "text" >> file.txt       # Append to file
sort < input.txt              # Redirect stdin
```

**Pipes:**
```bash
cat file.txt | grep hello     # Pipe output between commands
ls -l | wc -l                 # Count files in directory
```

**Background Jobs & Job Control:**
```bash
sleep 10 &                    # Run command in background
jobs                          # List active jobs
fg %1                         # Bring job 1 to foreground
bg %1                         # Continue job 1 in background
```

**Variable Expansion:**
```bash
echo $HOME                    # Environment variable
echo $$                       # Shell process ID
echo $?                       # Last command exit status
echo ${PATH:-/usr/bin}        # Variable with default value
```

**Exit:**
```bash
exit                          # Terminate the shell
```

Known Limitations
-----------------
- Quoting and escaping support is basic (handles simple quotes but not complex escaping)
- Redirection within pipelines is not fully supported (use either pipes OR redirection)
- Command history is not implemented
- No command-line editing features (no arrow keys, tab completion)
- Complex shell grammar (subshells, command substitution) not supported
- Limited error recovery in parsing edge cases

POSIX Compliance and Portability
--------------------------------
This shell is designed to be portable across Unix-like systems:

**Standards Compliance:**
- Uses `_POSIX_C_SOURCE 200809L` feature test macro
- Only POSIX-compliant system calls and library functions
- No vendor-specific extensions (no GNU/BSD/macOS-only features)
- Standard C17 language features only

**Tested Platforms:**
- macOS (with Command Line Tools)
- Linux distributions
- Should work on any POSIX-compliant Unix system

**System Calls Used:**
- `fork()`, `execvp()`, `waitpid()` - Process management
- `pipe()`, `dup2()` - I/O redirection and piping
- `open()`, `close()` - File operations
- `chdir()`, `getcwd()` - Directory operations
- `signal()`, `sigaction()` - Signal handling
- `kill()` - Job control

If you want improvements before submitting (variable expansion, improved parsing, bg builtin), tell me which and I'll implement them.

Collaboration statement:
I worked alone on this project.

Note about heredoc / pasted prompts:
----------------------------------
This shell intentionally does not try to guess or strip terminal prompt text that
might appear when you paste heredoc-style input (for example lines that begin
with something like "cmdand heredoc> "). If you paste such prompt text into a
heredoc or redirected input, the shell may try to execute those prompt fragments
as commands. To avoid this, paste only the raw commands (without your terminal's
prompt), or type the commands directly when using heredocs.
